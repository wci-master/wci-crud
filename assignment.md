# Web Development Fundamentals: CRUD Application Assignment

## Overview
In this assignment, you will build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This project will help you understand the fundamentals of web development, including user authentication, database operations, and responsive design.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement user authentication (signup and login)
- Create and manage database connections
- Develop CRUD operations for a resource
- Design a responsive user interface
- Practice proper code organization and structure
- Implement form validation and security measures

## Requirements

- Set up a proper project structure following MVC principles
- Create a MySQL database with appropriate tables
- Implement a configuration file for database connection

### 2. User Authentication (20 points)
- Create a registration page with the following fields:
  - Username (unique)
  - Email (unique)
  - Full Name
  - Password (with confirmation)
- Implement a login page

- Include navigation to other sections of the application

### 4. Profile Management (15 points)
- Allow users to view and edit their profile information
- Implement password change functionality
- Add proper validation for all form fields

- Use CSS to style the application appropriately
- Add JavaScript for enhanced user experience (e.g., form validation, dynamic content)

### 7. Documentation (5 points)
- Create a README.md file with:
  - Project description
  - Setup instructions
  - Features list
  - Technologies used
  - Project structure

## Bonus Features (Optional, up to 10 extra points)
Implement any of the following features for extra credit:
- Search functionality for the resource items
- Pagination for lists with many items
- Sorting and filtering options
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification for new accounts
- Remember me functionality for login
- Dark/light mode toggle

## Submission Guidelines
1. Create a GitHub repository for your project
2. Push your completed code to your GitHub repository
3. Include the SQL file for database creation in your repository
4. Provide a document with screenshots of your application
5. Include any special instructions for setting up and running your application
6. Submit the link to your GitHub repository to the WCI checker for evaluation

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Does the application work as expected?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, commented, and maintainable?
- Security: Are proper security measures implemented?
- UI/UX: Is the interface user-friendly and responsive?
- Documentation: Is the documentation clear and comprehensive?
